Microsoft SCVMM Job Monitor Trigger
Microsoft System Center VMM Job Monitor Trigger script allows for easy automation activities on SCVMM jobs. 
This was written as an alternative to Service Management Automation (SMA) in a Windows Azure Pack (WAP) environment because SMA was not going to be implemented in WAP. 
The only dependency is System Center Virtual Machine Monitor. 
Script was developed with SC VMM 2012 R2.
